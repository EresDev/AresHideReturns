#Ares Hide Returns 2.0 vqMod



This format require VQMod installation in your opencart. Download and place the Ares_Hide_Returns_2_0_1_vqmod.xml into your vqmod/xml folder. This extension just works great with almost any theme.

If you have issue with any theme, let me know and I will look into that.

The version 2.0.1 is only for vqmod. I've discontinued the non-vqmod version because I don't think people will use it.

**Enhancement in v2.0**


One return link was missed in last version in my account page. Thanks to "macaya" for letting me know about it and now the v2.0 also hides the returns link my account page.
